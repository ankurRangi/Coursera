# Week 03: Making Data Management Decisions

I have used three variables for the analysis,  **'Femaleemployrate'**, **'Urbanrate'**, and **'Lifeexpectancy'**.

 1. For Female-Employment Rate, it is clear that the most common response was 3 (45.07%), which means around 45% of the countries have their 
    female employment rate between 40% to 60%.

 2. For Urban Rate, the most common response was 2(62.44%) which explains more than half of the countries i.e. around 62%, have their urban 
    rate ranging from 25% to 75%.

 3. For Life Expectancy, the common response was 4 which is 35.68%. It means less than half of the countries have a life expectancy of more 
    than 65 and less than 75 years of age.
