### Graph 1 : Figure_1 (Fe_num) 2.png

This graph is unimodal, with its highest peak at the median category of (X-label: 60) 40 to 60% female employment rate. It seems to be skewed to the right as there are higher frequencies in lower categories than the higher categories. 

### Graph 2: Figure_1 (lyf) 2.png

This graph is unimodal, with its highest peak at (X-label: 75) 65 to 75 years old. It seems to be skewed to the left as there are higher frequencies in the higher age ranges. 

### Graph 3: Figure_1 (urb) 2.png

This graph is unimodal, with its single highest peak at the category of (X-label: 75) 25 to 75% urban rate.    

### Graph 4: regplot.png

The graph above plots the urban population rate of a country to the countryâ€™s corresponding life expectancy. We can see that the scatter graph does not show a clear relationship/trend between the two variables.
